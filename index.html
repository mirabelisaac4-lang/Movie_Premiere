        <h2>About the Movie</h2>
        <p>
            The Second Cut is a thought-provoking psychological drama about second chances — and the hidden cost of perfection. <br>

            At 25, Paina Freede feels like life is constantly one step ahead of her. Shy, self-critical, and exhausted from always <br>
            
            feeling “behind,” she longs for a version of herself that is confident, capable, and in control. But after a mysterious <br>
            encounter on her birthday, she is given access to something extraordinary — the ability to revisit and alter moments from <br>
            her own life. What begins as a subtle experiment quickly becomes a powerful opportunity to reshape her future. With each <br>
            adjustment, doors begin to open, conversations improve, and success feels closer than ever. Yet as her world becomes more <br>
            polished, a deeper question begins to surface: <br> <br>
            <strong>Is a perfected life the same as a meaningful one?</strong> <br> <br>
            Blending suspense, emotion, and self-reflection, The Second Cut explores identity, authenticity, and the courage it takes <br>
            to grow without a safety net. It’s a gripping journey that will leave audiences questioning what they would change — and <br>
            what they shouldn’t.

        <h2> Meet the Cast </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Paina Freede</strong> <br>
                The protagonist of The Second Cut. A thoughtful but insecure 25-year-old woman who feels constantly behind in life. <br>
                After being granted access to the mysterious Editing Room, she begins reshaping her days — only to confront the deeper <br>
                meaning of growth and authenticity.
            </li>
                    <br>
            <li>
                <strong>The Editor (real name unknown)</strong>
                    The calm, enigmatic man who introduces Paina to the Editing Room. He explains the rules and observes her choices without <br>
                    interference. Detached yet perceptive, he serves as both guide and quiet judge of her evolution.
            </li>
                    <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Mara Kessler</strong>
                    A confident and articulate colleague at Paina’s workplace. In Paina’s original timeline, Mara unintentionally intimidates <br>
                    her during meetings. Through edited versions of events, Mara becomes a benchmark for the kind of poise Paina wishes she had.
            </li>
                    <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Director Hale</strong>
                    The unseen supervisor within the Editing Room organization. Occasionally referenced by The Editor, Hale represents the larger <br>
                    system behind the mysterious selection process, reinforcing that the Editing Room operates with purpose — not randomness.
