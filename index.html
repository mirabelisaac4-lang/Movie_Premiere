        <h2>The Story</h2>

        <p>Paina Freede has always felt one step behind.</p>

        <p>
            Behind in conversations.<br>
            Behind in confidence.<br>
            Behind in life.
        </p>

        <p>On the night of her 25th birthday, everything changes.</p>

        <p>She wakes up in a metallic room — strapped to a chair — confronted by a mysterious man who tells her she has been “chosen.”</p>

        <p><strong>Chosen to edit her life.</strong></p>

        <p>Inside a futuristic space known as <strong>The Editing Room</strong>, Paina is shown footage of the exact day she just lived. Every awkward pause. Every mistake. Every missed opportunity.</p>

        <p>She is given access to change it.</p>

        <p><strong>Two rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot change the feelings of others.</li>
            <li>You cannot bring anyone back to life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Everything else? Editable.</strong></p>

        <p>
            At first, she makes small corrections.<br>
            Then bigger ones.<br>
            Until her life becomes flawless.
        </p>

        <p>But perfection comes at a cost.</p>

        <p>Because editing your mistakes is not the same as learning from them.</p>

        <p>And soon, Paina must decide:</p>

        <p><strong>Does she want control?<br>Or does she want growth?</strong></p>
